# Graphethon: Lost And Found
This is my graph-e-thon project held at National Level.

## Project Description:
The Lost and Found Bulletin Board project is a community-driven initiative that aims to make a positive impact in our local community. Its primary goal is to help individuals who have lost items, pets, or belongings by providing a simple and accessible platform to post information about their lost possessions. It also serves those who have found items and wish to return them to their rightful owners.
